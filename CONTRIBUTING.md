Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Environment setup

Nothing easier!

Fork and clone the repository, then:

```bash
cd python
make setup
```

> NOTE:
> If it fails for some reason,
> you'll need to install
> [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm)
> manually.
> 
> You can install it with:
> 
> ```bash
> python3 -m pip install --user pipx
> pipx install pdm
> ```
> 
> Now you can try running `make setup` again,
> or simply `pdm install`.

You now have the dependencies installed.

You can run the application with `pdm run mkdocstrings-python [ARGS...]`.

Run `make help` to see all the available actions!

## Tasks

This project uses [duty](https://github.com/pawamoy/duty) to run tasks.
A Makefile is also provided. The Makefile will try to run certain tasks
on multiple Python versions. If for some reason you don't want to run the task
on multiple Python versions, you can do one of the following:

1. `export PYTHON_VERSIONS= `: this will run the task
   with only the current Python version
2. run the task directly with `pdm run duty TASK`

The Makefile detects if a virtual environment is activated,
so `make` will work the same with the virtualenv activated or not.

## Development

As usual:

1. create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name`
1. edit the code and/or the documentation

**Before committing:**

1. run `make format` to auto-format the code
1. run `make check` to check everything (fix any warning)
1. run `make test` to run the tests (fix any issue)
1. if you updated the documentation or the project dependencies:
    1. run `make docs-serve`
    1. go to http://localhost:8000 and check that everything looks good
1. follow our [commit message convention](#commit-message-convention)

If you are unsure about how to fix or ignore a warning,
just let the continuous integration fail,
and we will help you during review.

Don't bother updating the changelog, we will take care of this.

## Commit message convention

Commits messages must follow the
[Angular style](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153#format-of-the-commit-message):

```
<type>[(scope)]: Subject

[Body]
```

Scope and body are optional. Type can be:

- `build`: About packaging, building wheels, etc.
- `chore`: About packaging or repo/files management.
- `ci`: About Continuous Integration.
- `docs`: About documentation.
- `feat`: New feature.
- `fix`: Bug fix.
- `perf`: About performance.
- `refactor`: Changes that are not features or bug fixes.
- `style`: A change in code style/format.
- `tests`: About tests.

**Subject (and body) must be valid Markdown.**
If you write a body, please add issues references at the end:

```
Body.

References: #10, #11.
Fixes #15.
```

## Pull requests guidelines

Link to any related issue in the Pull Request message.

During the review, we recommend using fixups:

```bash
# SHA is the SHA of the commit you want to fix
git commit --fixup=SHA
```

Once all the changes are approved, you can squash your commits:

```bash
git rebase -i --autosquash master
```

And force-push:

```bash
git push -f
```

If this seems all too complicated, you can push or force-push each new commit,
and we will squash them ourselves if needed, before merging.
